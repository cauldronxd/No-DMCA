NO-DMCA - Anti-Takedown Manifesto (2025)
========================================================================

This project is labeled NO-DMCA. This applies to single-player and multiplayer cheats.

Game companies have zero legitimate right to do any of the following:

Demand GitHub, Discord, Namecheap, Cloudflare, or any hosting provider hand over private user data (real names, IPs, emails, payment info) just because someone posted a cheat, a bypass, or a reverse-engineering thread. This practice is rampant (Activision, Easy Anti-Cheat, BattlEye, Tencent, miHoYo, Krafton, and others do it weekly) and is straight-up illegal under GDPR Article 82, CCPA §1798.150, Brazilian LGPD, and Canadian PIPEDA. These requests are not “DMCA compliance”; they are doxxing attempts disguised as copyright claims.

Send mass automated DMCA takedowns on purely client-side tools that never touch their servers, never reproduce assets, and never redistribute the game itself. Courts in the United States (Sega v. Accolade 1992, Sony v. Connectix 2000, Blizzard v. BnetD) have ruled for decades that reverse engineering for interoperability or private modification is fair use.

Pretend multiplayer cheating is some unique evil while the same publishers:
  - Openly sell pay-to-win items and accounts on their own stores (EA FC, Diablo Immortal, Genshin Impact, etc.)
  - Allow smurf accounts, region hopping, and VPN price abuse worth hundreds of millions yearly
  - Run gambling mechanics aimed at minors (FIFA packs, Honkai/Genshin banners ruled illegal in Belgium, Netherlands, and now under investigation in the US)
  - Ship kernel-level ring-0 anti-cheats (Vanguard, BattlEye, EAC, Ricochet, nProtect, XignCode) that have higher system privileges than most malware, have been caught phoning home private data, and have been remotely exploited multiple times
  - Abandon games within 6-18 months yet keep the store page up at full price with paid DLC (literally hundreds of examples every year)

I develop cheats (single-player and multiplayer) for exactly three reasons:

1. Education and security research (finding and exposing vulnerabilities publishers refuse to fix)
2. Personal satisfaction and technical challenge
3. Profit, but only from games that actively screw over their players with the practices listed above

If your game is reasonably priced, still updated in 2025, has no loot boxes or pay-to-win, and you don’t run kernel-level spyware on my machine, your game will never be on my target list. Period.

This document is permanent public notice that abusive, overly broad, or privacy-violating DMCA requests will be ignored, archived, and exposed along with the sender’s name and company.

Real copyright claims (almost none exist in this scene) will be reviewed. Everything else is noise.
