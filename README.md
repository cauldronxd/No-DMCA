NO-DMCA - Anti-Takedown Manifesto (Updated 2025)
========================================================================

This project is labeled NO-DMCA — including for multiplayer cheats.

Game companies and anti-cheat providers have no legitimate moral or legal right to:

• Issue DMCA takedowns against private individuals or communities that reverse-engineer, discuss, share, or develop client-side modifications — even for multiplayer titles  
• Abuse the DMCA process by demanding private user data (IP addresses, emails, real names, account IDs, etc.) from forums such as UnknownCheats, EPVP, GuidedHacking, MPGH, or any other community. This is textbook abuse of the DMCA is illegal in most jurisdictions (GDPR Art. 82, CCPA §1798.150, etc.) and will always be refused and publicly exposed  
• Pretend that cheating in multiplayer is some new unforgivable crime when the same companies:
  - Sell pay-to-win advantages themselves
  - Allow region-price exploiting, VPN abuse, and account selling on a massive scale
  - Deliberately design addictive, predatory monetization systems
  - Abandon games after milking them while still charging full price
  - Use invasive kernel-level anti-cheats that spy on users far more than any cheat ever could

I (and many other developers in this scene) create cheats — single-player and multiplayer — for only three reasons:

1. Educational purposes, reverse-engineering practice, and security research  
2. Personal enjoyment and the raw technical challenge  
3. Income — but exclusively from titles that deserve it:
   • Extreme pay-to-win or gambling mechanics (loot boxes, battle passes, etc.)
   • Developers/publishers with a proven track record of lying to or screwing over players
   • Games that are dead, abandoned, or region-locked yet still sold at full price
   • Titles protected by creepy always-online DRM or kernel-level spyware masquerading as “anti-cheat”

If your game is fairly priced, actively updated, free of predatory monetization, and you don’t treat your players like walking wallets — your game will never appear here. Simple as that.

Weaponizing the DMCA against individual researchers and small cheat developers instead of improving your netcode, server-side validation or simply making a better game only proves your incompetence and greed.

This is a permanent, public refusal to comply with any abusive, overly broad, or privacy-violating DMCA notice — for single-player or multiplayer projects alike.

Legitimate claims (extremely rare) will be reviewed case-by-case.  
Everything else gets ignored, laughed at, and archived for the world to see.
